## Project Description:

We are developing a web application to promote a healthy and active lifestyle through the platform of peer support. Our goal is to build a community of users motivated to achieving fitness and dietary goals by creating challenges where other users join that challenge.

Our core features are logging in a user, registering a user, signing out a user, viewing a challenges, joining/withdrawing from a challenge, updating your progress on a challenge, creating a challenge, viewing the message board, and viewing profiles.

We decided to host our application on Microsoft Azure.

## How to Use:


Register to create your own account. When you log in, a navbar with your username will appear.

Next go to the explore page and view the list of challenges. The number of each challenge is the number of people enrolled in this challenge. You can view other peoples profiles by clicking on their usernames. Join a BOTH of these challenges and watch the number rise. 

Create a challenge as well and return to the explore page to see the challenge you just created.

Next click on the navbar with your username and select profile. Here you can view all the challenges that you are currently enrolled in. If you are enrolled in a challenge, you may either withdraw from that challenge, update you’re progress, or view the challenge page again to see the description and everyone else’s progress.

If you choose to view the challenge, you can see everyone who is taking part of the challenge and their progress. If you click on their username you can view their profile to see what other challenges they are in. You may also click peoples usernames from the explore page to see their profiles and whatever challenges they are in.

You can also view the message board to see the latest messages from administrators.

Next click the calorie counter feature and enter in AARDVARK HABENERO HOT SAUCE or RAW BROCCOLI LEAF CRISPS or SPICY TUNA ROLL and submit the form to see how many calories it has through the API we have chosen.

The reason for these specific examples is that the API database is extremely specific and simple queries such as 'apple' or 'banana' return many matches of different products like apple pie, cider, etc.

When you are finished, either repeat the process or signout (located in the left nabber).
